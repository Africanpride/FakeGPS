# FakeGPS
FakeGPS is a Windows 10 driver which allows the user to provide geolocation information without a physical GPS device.

## Why?
Windows 10 includes Cortana, a digital assistant which can help you with location based reminders.
When there is no GPS device, the location services in Windows will try to guess where you are geographically using other means like Wi-Fi or IP address.
These methods don't always work, rendering the features of Cortana as useless.

This is especially noticeable on virtual machines which provide geolocation of the cloud infrastructure, not where the user is.

## When?
Soon as possible.
