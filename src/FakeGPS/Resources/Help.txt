Usage: FakeGPS <command>

FakeGPS -g              get current status
FakeGPS -s <lat,long>   set latitude and longitude

Example:

PS> FakeGPS -s 51.51786,-0.102216
The following location has been set in the driver's registry settings:
Lat:    51.51786
Long:   -0.102216

PS> FakeGPS -g
The following location has been got from the Windows location API:
Lat:    51.51786
Long:   -0.102216

Note: Once you have set the latitude and longitude you may need to restart the device driver for it take effect. This is due to the Geolocation driver caching the last result and may be fixed in future versions.
